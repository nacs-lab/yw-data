Papers using TeNPy
==================

This page collects papers using (and citing) the TeNPy library, both as an inspiration what can be done, as well as to keep
track of the usage, such that we can see how useful our work is to the community. It keeps us motivated!

To include your own work, you can either
fill out `this template on github <https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy/issues/new?&labels=doc&template=paper-using-tenpy.md&title=[cite]>`_,
or you can directly add your citation in `this Zotero online library <https://www.zotero.org/groups/2569413/tenpy/items>`_ (and notify us about it or just wait).

Entries in the following list are sorted by year-author.
